<h3>* What's Squirrel Linux ? </h3>

<h3>* Why GSL ? </h3>

<h3>* Features </h3>

* Minimal and Full installation
For while we don't have netinstall, but it's coming.

* LiveCD
With i3wm GSL became the fastest and greatest LiveCD in Linux 

* Linux with a pinch of BSD, Together is better.
Why still using Bash, try out zsh. Maybe Ipfilter ? 

* Ports and Pkg
Under Construction :)

* ZFS and Brtfs
Brtfs by default, but why not Ext4 and ZFS ?
