# SquirrelLinux


# SPM - Squirrel Packet Manager
Pacman but better and stable

# GNL - Ground Squirrel Linux
Low level packet manager

# .SLP - Squirrel Linux Packet
Build and distribute, an universal distro packet

# Systemd or SystemV

# Minimal and Full installation

# Linux with a pinch of BSD
Together is better

# Iptables is garbage

# Ports and Pkg

# Zfs and Brtfs
