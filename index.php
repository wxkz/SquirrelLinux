        <h2>GSL 5.6.2 released</h2>
        <p>GSL version 5.6.2 has been released. Version 5.6 brings an improved virtual memory system, updates to radeon and ttm, and performance improvements for HAMMER2. The 5.6.1 release fixes a sshd configuration error and a lockup bug in ttm. 5.6.2 brings in a pile of stability and bug fixes from master, including several serious paging issues that could cause the machine to thrash.</p>

        <h2>What is GSL Linux ?</h2>
        <p>DragonFly belongs to the same class of operating systems as other BSD-derived systems and Linux. It is based on the same UNIX ideals and APIs and shares ancestor code with other BSD operating systems. DragonFly provides an opportunity for the BSD base to grow in an entirely different direction from the one taken in the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD series. </p>
        <p>DragonFly includes many useful features that differentiate it from other operating systems in the same class.</p>
